## Data:
* Data base that going to be use is The Northwind database
* Database has 14 tables.

## Tools
* SQL
* Tableau
* Numpy
* Pandas
* squarify
* pywaffle

## Project Description:
* Cleaning data was done using different methods such as using measures of central tendency and variability as well as checking for null values and duplication : <a href="https://github.com/MohammedDev315/DataScience/blob/master/EDA_Northwind_Project/basic_data_checking.py"> Show code </a>
* Database has several regions and to choose top five regions, comparison among these regions done using those code : <a href="https://github.com/MohammedDev315/DataScience/blob/master/EDA_Northwind_Project/comparison_between_regions.py">First Page</a>
